                Hey, This is my first complete end to end deployment project. I have used the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data" class="desc_links">Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data</a>.
                The model being used under the hood is a CatBoostClassifier.
                I tried 5 different ensemble models like, GradientBoosting, XGBoost, RandomForest, LightGBM & CatBoost.
                Out of all CatBoost performed the best with an accuracy of about 92%.
            </h4>
            <h4> So, I chose to train another CatBoostClassifier, so as to pass
                it into a Soft Voting Ensemble Classifier with a purpose of increasing the accuracy. But, the second indivitual trained CatBoostClassifier
                outperformed both the first CatBoostClassifier as well as the SoftVotingClassifier (two CatBoostClassifiers). The accuracy of second CatBoostClassifier
                was 96% on Validation set, & 97% on Test set, where as the accuracy of SoftVotingClassifier was 95% on Validation Set. Hence, I chose the second CatBoostClassifier. 
            </h4>
            <p id="kaggle_notebook">I have attached my kaggle notebook link below: (The best model is different because I used Colab for training and then uploaded the notebook on kaggle)</p>

            <p id="bc_description"> 
                Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control.
                Breast cancer cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, but men can get breast cancer, too.
                Itâ€™s important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant). Non-cancerous breast tumors are abnormal growths, but they do not spread outside of the breast.<br>
                They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast lumps can increase a woman's risk of getting breast cancer. Any breast lump or change needs to be checked by a health care professional<br>
                to determine if it is benign or malignant (cancer) and if it might affect your future cancer risk.
